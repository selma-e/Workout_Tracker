# Selma's HW17 Workout Tracker

## Description:

In this activity, I am building a workout tracker. In it, you can add new resistance or cardio exercises on a daily basis if you'd like. You can also see the information propagated from your last workout. The fitness dashboard then displays your workout details including the total duration of workouts over the course of a 7 day period. For my database, I am utilizing Mongo DB and my schema is built from the node package Mongoose.

## A couple of things I learned in this:

- I read up on aggregate functions, but ended up using the .reduce method for arrays.
- Mongoose node package for Schema building
